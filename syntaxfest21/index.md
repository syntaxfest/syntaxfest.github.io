# The Syntaxfest 2021 in Sofia (will be held from 21 March to 25 March 2022)

### 4 events for 1 Fest of Empirical Syntax

 The second edition of the SyntaxFest brings together again four events with partially overlapping research topics including empirical syntax, linguistic annotation, statistical language analysis, and Natural Language Processing:
* [Quasy](https://quasy-2021.webnode.cz/) : The Workshop on Quantitative Syntax
* [Depling](https://depling.org/depling2021/) : The Conference on Dependency Linguistics
* [TLT](https://tlt2021.phil.hhu.de/) : The International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories 
* [UDW](https://universaldependencies.org/udw21/) : The Universal Dependencies Workshop

### Registration

[SyntaxFest Registration Link](https://www.softconf.com/ranlp2021/ranlp2021reg) is now OPEN.

> For any questions, related to the payments, please write to the following email: ** syntaxfest@acl-bg.org **

SyntaxFest is planned as a hybrid event, but due to the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, we might have to revert to online-only. 

For this reason, **ONLY the online fee of 50 EUR** has to be paid upon registration. 

This fee has to be paid by at least one author per accepted paper for the paper to be included in the Proceedings. 
The deadline for this is _December 10, 2021_. 

For the cancellation policy that applies to other participants, please see the information
in the registration form.

If the situation permits a hybrid mode and thus, participants in Sofia,
onsite participants will be asked to pay an additional fee.

Please note that the registration can be performed **only for all days of SyntaxFest**. It is not possible to register for half a week or one/two workshops.

Please also note that the payment system is external to the registration, thus you will receive the confirmation document later on, possibly in a few days.


### Modality
The next and second edition will be held in a hybrid mode: online and in Sofia. Both venues will be communicated later.

### Proceedings
For the authors’s convenience, despite the conference being held in March 2022, the Proceedings of Syntaxfest 2021 will be published in December 2021 in the ACL Anthology.

### Registration

Registration is not open yet.
Registration will be done in two steps:

1. After the evaluation process, all participants will have to register for the online event (reduced registration costs).
2. Approximately one month before the conference, participants will be offered to decide whether they want to come to Sofia or not, if the health situation allows it. Additional costs will be charged in accordance.

### Paper submission information

#### Submission page
Papers must be submitted in PDF format exclusively through the SyntaxFest 
[joint submission page](
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=syntaxfest2021)


#### Paper length
We invite two types of submissions: long papers and short papers.
- Long papers may consist of up to 10 pages of content (excluding references and appendices);
- Short papers may consist of up to 6 pages of content (excluding references and appendices).
- Any appendices should be included in the paper PDF.

#### Style guidelines
All submissions should follow the common SyntaxFest 2021 stylesheet (based on the one-column COLING 2020 style guidelines). Stylesheets are provided as LaTeX style file and Microsoft Word templates (templates might be subject to slight modifications for compatibility reasons). The files are downloadable from [Depling site](https://depling.org/depling2021/). See section _Style guidelines_.

#### Double-blind reviews

Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Zeng, 2018) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Zeng (2018) previously showed ...". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

### Shared reviewing process

On the [submission site](
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=syntaxfest2021), authors submit their paper only once for the whole SyntaxFest, composed of 4 conferences, but they can uncheck conferences they do not wish their paper to be considered for. If the paper is deemed appropriate for more than one of the selected conferences, the SyntaxFest joint organization committee decides on the final placement of the paper, which implies the day of the presentation and the proceedings the paper will appear in.
