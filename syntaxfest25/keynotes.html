												Miryam de Lhoneux is an assistant professor in the department of Computer Science at KU Leuven in Belgium, researching and teaching Natural Language Processing. She heads the LAGoM NLP lab where the focus is on multilingual and interpretable models. Previously, she was a postdoc at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. She has a PhD from Uppsala University, Sweden, an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh, UK, and a BA and MA in languages and literatures from UCLouvain, Belgium.

												My research in computational linguistics is mostly centered around morphological analysis and dependency syntax of natural languages. I am interested in computational models of morphology and syntax, including preparation of annotated data to train such models.

												I am particularly interested in multilingual approaches that work for many typologically different languages, cross-lingual techniques that support disadvantaged languages with little resources, and harmonized data resources that support multilingual processing. Besides training models, I also look into ways how these datasets can be used in comparative linguistics and typology.
												
												Beyond surface syntax I am working on deep syntactic relations, semantic roles and coreference. In the past I also worked on statistical machine translation for morphologically rich languages.

												I am a computational linguist specializing in work on and with corpora, including corpus linguistics studies, building corpora, and creating annotation interfaces and NLP tools that make corpus creation easier. I also run the Georgetown University Corpus Linguistics lab, Corpling@GU, and I am currently president of the ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation (SIGANN).


												My main research interests are in computational models of discourse, above the sentence level: I study "how we construct discourse, given what we want to say". In particular, I have been working on predictive computational models of referentiality and discourse relations. Which entities do we track in conversation? How are they introduced into the discourse and referred back to? How do we recognize discourse relations which signal how a current utterance relates to preceding or subsequent utterances, such as by contrasting with other claims, or supporting them with evidence? How do we signal the main point of a text or a paragraph, and how do we signal supporting information?
												
												
												For example, if we read even a very short text such as "Yun fell. Kim pushed her", we infer a lot of things: we understand that there are two events, that the same two people were involved in both (her=Yun), that the second probably happened before the first, and that the first was caused by the second. But how do we do this? And can we make computers understand these kinds of inferences? It turns out that computers find this very hard!

										<h3>Workshop on Quantitative Syntax (QUASY)</h3>
									</header>

										<img style="width: 233px;" src="images/keynotes/Lu.jpeg" alt="Image of Xiaofei Lu"/>
										<div class="speaker-details">
											<div class="speaker-name">Xiaofei Lu</div>
											<div class="speaker-affiliation">The Pennsylvania State University</div>
											<p>
												Xiaofei Luâ€™s research interests are primarily in corpus linguistics, English for Academic Purposes, second language writing, second language acquisition, and computer-assisted language learning. He has had a longstanding interest in issues related to lexical and syntactic complexity. He has made available several computational tools to facilitate their automated analysis, including the L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer, the Lexical Complexity Analyzer, and the D-Level Analyzer. He has also conducted numerous studies to investigate the relationship of lexical and syntactic complexity to language proficiency, language development, and language production quality as well as the effects of various learner- and task-related factors on this relationship. His current research calls for closer attention to the meaning and function dimensions of linguistic complexity and highlights a framework that integrates corpus- and genre-based approaches to academic writing research, teaching, and assessment, with a particular focus on the linguistic realizations of different rhetorical and communicative functions in different genres of academic writing. Xiaofei Lu teaches several courses on corpus linguistics (APLNG 578; APLNG 579) and technology-mediated language learning (APLNG 588; APLNG 589). He is the author of Corpus linguistics and second language acquisition: Perspectives, issues, and findings (Routledge, 2023) and Computational methods for corpus annotation and analysis (Springer, 2014) and lead co-editor (with Berlin Chen) of Computational and corpus approaches to Chinese language learning (Springer, 2019).

												I work on understanding and defining the capabilities of large language models in relation to the human language system.

                                        		I am especially interested in pursuing an interdisciplinary research program, combining computational empirical machine learning methods with theories of human language. My principal interests include: how language models learn and use generalizable grammatical abstractions, the interaction between structure and meaning representations in high-dimensional vector spaces, and using multilingual settings to test the limits of abstraction in language models.
